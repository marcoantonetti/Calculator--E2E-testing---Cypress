To run the application you can use --> npm start                                this will open in a 8080 port by default
To run the tests execute the command --> npm test --port 8080                   or change the port value with the desired port
If you run the application with open live server then the port might be different, hence you need to change the --port number to run the tests

If the localhost or server is on a different port, you need to change the baseUrl value with that port in the cypress.config.js file
